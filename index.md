# I'm a data librarian in training living in Ann Arbor, Michigan. 

In 2011, I started teaching adult learners from diverse backrounds how to double-click, browse Wikipedia, and  enter functions into Excel. 

Six years later, I still love helping learners work towards their goals with technology, but I draw upon a different toolkit: developing web applications and open source software, consulting with clients from diverse backgrounds and with varying levels of technical expertise, mentoring young developers, and writing.

As a **Data Visualization Intern** in the [Digital Projects Studio](http://clarkdatalabs.github.io) at the University of Michigan Library, I collaborate with small teams on projects spanning the data analysis pipeline, design and teach workshops, and write about code. Learn more about our [latest visualization of the NASA Space Shuttle program](https://clarklabs.lib.umich.edu/2017/11/08/using_processing_visualize_space_exploration/).

**Key methodologies:** Web application development; technical project management; mixed-methods research; data visualization and storytelling; technical writing

**Key technical skills:** Python, Django, R, SQL, Natural Language Processing, pandas

**Learning-in-progress:** TensorFlow, Tableau, JavaScript


Outside of work I love pinball, zines, hikes, cats, and trains.
