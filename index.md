# I'm a software developer in training living in Ann Arbor, Michigan. 

How do we identify stories in complex data? My focus on data storytelling brings together a genuine interest in listening empathetically with using words and code to craft narratives.

As a **Data Visualization Intern** in the [Digital Projects Studio](http://clarkdatalabs.github.io) (University of Michigan Libraries), I grapple with ambiguous and messy data, as well as support the problem-solving processes of diverse clients via consulting, writing, teaching, and developing. 

**Key methodologies:** Data storytelling and visualization; web application development; mixed-methods research; technical writing

**Key technical skills:** Python, R, SQL, Tableau, HTML/CSS, Django, JavaScript, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Ruby on Rails

Outside of work I love pinball, zines, hikes, cats, and trains.
